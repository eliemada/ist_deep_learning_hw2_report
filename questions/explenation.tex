\subsection{Task Division}

When working on this project we split up the tasks between the two of us. Results to question 1 were provided by Maira Gauges and while Elie Bruno worked on question 2. Each wrote the code to obtain the results and included results in the report. 

The third question was again split. While Maira provided answers to 3.1 and 3.2, Elie solved 3.3. and 3.4 and furthermore transferred the results of all of question 3 into latex notation and hence into the report. 


\subsection{Use of Chat GPT / AI Tools}
AI tools were used to help with the understanding of how to use numpy functions and where which numpy function could be useful. It was not used to write full code, however was once used to check if it could help find a mistake in the code that was self written.
